## Research Experience 

### **Newcastle University, Project and Dissertation in Data Science for Postgraduate** `2020.5 - 2020.9`
_"Classification of Skin Cancer Dermoscopy Images Using Deep Learning"_
- <u>Supervisor</u>: [Dr Yu Guan](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/yuguan.html)
<br>


Completed research independently and built a pipeline for multi-classification of dermoscopy skin cancer images based on deep neural network and transfer learning method to assist in the initial diagnosis of skin cancer, _i.e., Distinguish the category of images to judge benign and malignant_. In particular, I used a series of ImageNet pre-trained models(_i.e., Xception, ResNext50, VGG16, DenseNet201_) and fine-tuned them with a dataset of dermoscopy images provided by [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main). I built a benchmark model as a baseline to compare the performance of all the different models on the validation set and analyze their structures. Moreover, I made a filter visualizing utility to visualize the filters in the model and inspect the feature extraction process. The framework I applied to this project was Tensorflow and Keras.

### **Projects**


#### **Data Analysis and Processing in the Digitized Middle Platform**`2021.6 `
Cleaned and visualized the data of the company's different products, produced data dashboards; Participated in product iteration and experience improvements such as new users, recommendations, and user portraits, as well as promoted business definition, tracking and implementation through data analysis.



#### **Public Opinion System Text Classification Task** `2021.12 `
Sentiment classification of first- and third-party forum user comment data provided by a Chinese automobile company. Concretely speaking, I fine-tuned the pre-trained model for the Chinese text classification task on a small portion of annotated user comment data as a training set and then predicted on the unlabeled comment data.
Through the model, text can be classified as positive, negative and neutral.



#### **Automatic Feature Engineering Pipeline for Customer Data Platform Project** `2022.2 `
Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a marketing technology that aggregates customer data from multiple, multi-data sources, and then shares this data with other applications. In the CDP project, I was in charge of developing an Automatic feature engineering pipeline which is used to generate and transform the original data for preprocessing and pass it to the automatic machine learning module in CDP. Specifically, this pipeline converts raw tabular data into a format ready for the machine learning model to read and attempts to enhance some new features/columns to provide more information to the machine learning model and hopefully more accurate results. The pipeline is composed of multiple feature generators, each feature generator has different processing functions.


#### **Extract the Specified Key Words/Sentences of the Text Through the NLP Method of Extractive Q&A** `2022.5 `
The data sourced from the content of procurement and bidding announcements crawled from the bidding information platform. For the basic information of the text in a unified format  _e.g., Announcement release time, Announcement name, Announcement area etc._, I used regular expressions to match and obtain. For files written in special formats and the extraction of complex information _e.g., Bidding content, Buyer contact information, Purchasing agency name etc._, I transformed this problem into a Question-Answering reading comprehension task. Annotated the answers to key questions in the text of a small number of documents as a training set and finetuned the pre-trained model for the Chinese Question-Answering task (_i.e., roberta-base-chinese-extractive-qa_) with this dataset. Predicted the answers in the text through key questions to achieve the effect of keywords/sentence extraction.
